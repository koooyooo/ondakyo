> "Ondakyo" is a shrine that believes in salvation by God's **grace**. Especially, we believe gods dwelling in electric media.
But they say "heaven helps those who help themselves", self-help efforts are highly respected here. 

恩田教は神の**恩**によって救われることを信じる教えです。 特に電子媒体に宿る神を信仰します。
ですが「天は自ら助くるものを助く」といいます。自助努力も忘れてはいけません。
